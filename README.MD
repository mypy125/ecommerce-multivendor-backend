# E-Commerce Project (Backend)

## Project Description

This project is an e-commerce platform with functionality divided into three main roles: **users** (customers), **sellers**, and **administrators**. The backend handles all the business logic, data processing, storage, user authentication, order and product management, and integrations with external services like email notifications and payment gateways.

---

## Technology Stack (Backend)

### üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data storage.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication, authorization, and API security.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For securely transmitting user data between the client and server.
- **Java Mail Sender**: For sending email notifications to users.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For simplified interaction with the database via ORM.
- **Spring Batch** (optional): For batch data processing.

### üóÑÔ∏è Database
- **PostgreSQL** is used for storing all data regarding users, orders, products, and transactions.

### üîí Security
- **Spring Security** and **JWT** are used for securing the application (authentication and authorization).

### üìß Notifications
- **Java Mail Sender** is used for sending email notifications to users (e.g., order confirmation, password reset, etc.).

## Main Features of the Backend

### 1. **User Management**
- **Registration & Authentication**: User registration and JWT-based authentication.
- **User Profiles**: Edit user details, manage delivery addresses.
- **Order History**: Retrieve past orders, with filtering and pagination options.

### 2. **Order Management**
- **Create and Process Orders**: Creating orders, recalculating prices, and changing order statuses.
- **Order Tracking**: Retrieve the current status of an order (in progress, completed, cancelled).
- **Order Cancellations and Returns**: Handle order cancellations and product returns.
- **Payments**: Integration with external payment services for transaction processing.

### 3. **Product and Category Management**
- **Create & Edit Products**: Sellers can add products, manage categories, and update product details.
- **Search & Filter**: Implement search and filtering mechanisms for products based on categories, price, and ratings.

### 4. **Cart and Items**
- **Cart Management**: Add/remove products from the cart, update product quantities.
- **Cart Item Management**: Handle requests for adding products to the cart and modifying quantities.

### 5. **Reviews and Ratings**
- **Product Reviews**: Users can leave reviews for products.
- **Product Rating**: Recalculate the average rating of products based on reviews.

### 6. **Coupons and Discounts**
- **Coupon Creation**: Admins can create discount coupons.
- **Coupon Application**: Customers can apply coupons for discounts during checkout.

### 7. **Payments and Transactions**
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment services like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Transaction History**: Track and manage all payment transactions in the system.

### 8. **Admin Panel**
- **User & Seller Management**: Admins can manage users, sellers, and block/unblock accounts.
- **Product & Order Management**: Admins can modify order statuses and edit products.
- **Content Management**: Admins can update content on the homepage, create promotions, and manage deals.

## Architecture and Component Interaction

### Architecture

- **Spring Boot** handles incoming HTTP requests, executes business logic, and interacts with the database.
- **PostgreSQL** is used for storing data about users, orders, products, and transactions.
- **Spring Security** and **JWT** provide authentication and authorization for the application.
- **Spring Data JPA** simplifies database interaction by automatically generating SQL queries for entity management.
- **Java Mail Sender** sends email notifications to users, such as order confirmations and password resets.

### Frontend and Backend Interaction
- The backend processes requests from the frontend (React) through the REST API.
- Responses from the server are returned in JSON format, which is then processed and displayed on the frontend.
- Authentication is handled using JWT, which is passed in HTTP headers for secure communication.

## Scalability Opportunities

- **Microservices**: The project can be split into microservices, such as order processing, user management, and product catalog services.
- **Caching**: Implement caching with services like **Redis** to improve performance.
- **Big Data Processing**: For reporting and analytics, **Spring Batch** can be used for batch data processing.
